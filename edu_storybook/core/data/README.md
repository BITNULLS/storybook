# Sensitive Core Data

This folder will contain two sensitive key files needed to temporarily download
all other sensitive files needed to launch the web server.

You will need to download two files into this directory:

 - [`StorybookFiles.json`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HVrLbauaq_3jEqMXVs9yUFw0UIGSiPDP/view?usp=sharing)
 - [`StorybookFiles.pem`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14r0GyoITrOjcbVH_RaezkB8TL7gzBTfR/view?usp=sharing)

You will need to have permission to download the files from Google Drive.

These two files are on the `.gitignore`, and should not be committed.
