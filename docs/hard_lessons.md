# Hard Lessons

1. Do not commit binary files unless it's for documentation or permanently needed.
2. `Sphinx` is the dominant documentation generator for Python, and it's so bloated and complicated to setup. `pdoc` is infinitely better.
3. `string.Template` is a really basic find-and-replace templating engine, and it's miles better than other more complicated, bloated, and slow templating engines.
