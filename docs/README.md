## Generating Documentation Instructions

From the root of the repo (outside of this directory):

```
make docs
```

Ensure that you have installed the Python requirements, which includes `pdoc` used for generating the documentation.

## Notes

 - Please read the `README.md` in the current directory that you are working in.  They all contain useful information on the scripts and files they are responsible for.
